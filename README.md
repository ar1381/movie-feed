# üé¨ MovieFeed
MovieFeed is a movie discovery app for Android, built using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. It allows users to browse movies across different categories, view detailed movie information including scores, genres, release dates, and billed cast members. This project helped me further explore Android development and Jetpack Compose's declarative UI patterns, and I hope it helps you in your journey too!

## üìΩÔ∏è MovieFeed - A Modern Movie Discovery Application
MovieFeed utilizes The Movie Database (TMDb) API to provide users with up-to-date movie information. It features a clean, intuitive interface built with Jetpack Compose and showcases best practices such as MVVM architecture, Hilt for dependency injection, Retrofit for network operations, and Coroutines for handling background tasks.

## üöÄ Features
Browse Movie Categories: Explore various categories like "Popular", "Top Rated", "Now Playing", and more.
Movie Details: View comprehensive details about each movie, including:
Rating: Movie scores and reviews.
Genres: Genre tags associated with each movie.
Release Date: Know when the movie was released.
Duration: Check the runtime of the movie.
Cast Information: Get the list of billed cast members along with the characters they play.
Dynamic and Responsive UI: Built with Jetpack Compose to offer a modern and smooth user experience.
##üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Kotlin: The primary language for building Android applications, enabling concise and expressive code.
Jetpack Compose: Android's modern UI toolkit for building native interfaces.
MVVM Architecture: Separates business logic from UI, ensuring clean, maintainable code.
Hilt: Dependency injection framework used to streamline object creation and lifecycle management.
Retrofit: For making network requests to the TMDb API.
Coroutines & Flow: Manage background operations and state efficiently.
Coil: For fast and efficient image loading (used for movie posters and cast photos).
